I currently work at [WaveOne](http://wave.one/ "WaveOne homepage"), where we are building next generation media compression technology using machine learning.  

Prior to joining WaveOne in 2017, I was part of [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mtc/locations/siliconvalley.aspx)'s remote desktop (RDP) core video codec team. At Microsoft, our team was responsible for moving RDP to use [standardized codecs](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/01/11/remote-desktop-protocol-rdp-10-avch-264-improvements-in-windows-10-and-windows-server-2016-technical-preview/) which resulted in proliferation of RDP technology across different Operating Systems.

Previously, I was part of [Intel](http://www/intel.com)'s graphics and camera team where I 
held several technical and management leadership roles. 

I graduated from [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) with a MS degree in Computer Science.
